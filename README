h6. Note

The OAuthFilter must be declared before the Google GuiceFilter, com.google.inject.servlet.GuiceFilter, if it exist in the web.xml file.


h6. Customization

The current implementation access the consumer data (key/secret/rsakey) via the table, OAUTH_CONSUMER, from the NIB database.&nbsp; If this is not desirable one can modify the persistence.xml file in the project accordingly.&nbsp; Also one needs to modify the APIKey's project to write the data to a different table/db as needed. &nbsp;
